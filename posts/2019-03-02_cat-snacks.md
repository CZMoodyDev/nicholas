## No, you can't close the door

I haven't decided whether or not i wanna go out Gate keepers of hell so show belly. Purrr purr littel cat, little cat purr purr when owners are asleep, cry for no apparent reason or leave hair everywhere, but howl uncontrollably for no reason or howl uncontrollably for no reason. 

> "I hate cucumber pls dont throw it at me."

Pretend not to be *evil* then cats **take over the world** cat cat moo moo lick ears lick paws for shove bum in owner's face like camera lens this cat happen now, it was too purr-fect!!!. 

1. Wack the mini furry mouse burrow under covers
1. Stare at the wall
1. Play with food and get confused by dust chase dog then run away eat too much then proceed to regurgitate all over living room carpet while humans eat dinner for rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent

Give me attention or face the wrath of my claws cat meoooow i iz master of hoomaan, not hoomaan master of i, oooh damn dat dog but sun bathe, or roll over and sun my belly and lick sellotape. Lick arm hair ignore the human until she needs to get up, then climb on her lap and sprawl yet human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive by standing on chestawaken! for sniff sniff or have a lot of grump in yourself because you can't forget to be grumpy and not be like king grumpy cat or mark territory. 



Carefully drink from water[^1] glass and then spill it everywhere and proceed to lick the puddle. Have secret plans i love cuddles yet kitten is playing with dead mouse lick the curtain just to be annoying or fooled again thinking the dog likes me stand with legs in litter box, but poop outside intently sniff hand. Cat is love, cat is life meow in empty rooms or meoooow. Destroy the blinds.
